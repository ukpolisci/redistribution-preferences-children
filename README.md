This repository contains the replication materials for the paper 'Parental Unemployment and Support for Redistribution during the Formative Years', submitted in partial fulfilment of the MPhil in Politics (Comparative Government) at the University of Oxford.

The paper examines the formation of redistribution preferences within the family by combining explanations based on material self-interest with a socialisation pathway for preference formation.
